# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The EKS Upgrade Agent is an autonomous AI system designed to manage the complete lifecycle of Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) version upgrades with zero downtime. The system employs a Blue/Green deployment strategy to maximize safety, eliminate downtime, and enable multi-version jumps. The agent follows an agentic AI paradigm with perception, reasoning, and execution capabilities, leveraging AWS AI services including Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Comprehend, AWS Step Functions, and Amazon EventBridge for intelligent decision-making and orchestration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want an autonomous agent to upgrade my EKS cluster with zero downtime, so that I can maintain service availability while keeping my infrastructure current.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an upgrade is initiated, THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL provision a Green_Cluster with the target EKS version
2. WHILE traffic shifting occurs, THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL maintain 100% service availability
3. IF any validation step fails during upgrade, THEN THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL automatically rollback traffic to the Blue_Cluster
4. THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL support multi-version jumps (e.g., 1.27 to 1.29)
5. WHEN the upgrade completes successfully, THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL decommission the Blue_Cluster

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want the agent to automatically detect deprecated APIs and breaking changes, so that I can address compatibility issues before they cause failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning begins, THE Deprecation_Scanner SHALL identify deprecated APIs in both live clusters and manifest files
2. THE Release_Notes_Analyzer SHALL extract breaking changes, API deprecations, and required actions from official release notes
3. IF deprecated APIs are detected, THEN THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL halt the upgrade and alert operators
4. THE Perception_Module SHALL collect comprehensive cluster state including node groups, add-ons, and dependent services
5. WHEN analysis completes, THE Reasoning_Module SHALL generate a dynamic plan incorporating all findings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want gradual traffic shifting with automated validation, so that I can ensure the new cluster performs correctly before full migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Traffic_Manager SHALL implement weighted traffic distribution using AWS Route 53
2. WHEN traffic shifting begins, THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL start with 10% traffic to the Green_Cluster
3. THE Validation_Module SHALL verify health metrics, error rates, and application functionality at each traffic increment
4. IF validation passes, THEN THE Traffic_Manager SHALL progressively increase traffic (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
5. THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL run automated test suites against both clusters during validation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a cloud architect, I want the agent to integrate with existing Infrastructure as Code and GitOps workflows, so that upgrades align with our deployment practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE IaC_Executor SHALL provision infrastructure using Terraform and EKS Blueprints
2. THE GitOps_Executor SHALL integrate with ArgoCD or Flux for application deployment synchronization
3. WHEN provisioning occurs, THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL apply existing Terraform configurations to the Green_Cluster
4. THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL trigger GitOps sync operations to deploy applications on the new cluster
5. WHERE backup requirements exist, THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL integrate with Velero for cluster state backup

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want comprehensive validation and rollback capabilities, so that failed upgrades don't compromise system stability or security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Health_Checker SHALL verify EKS control plane, node group, and pod health status
2. THE Metrics_Analyzer SHALL monitor key performance indicators including error rates and latency
3. THE Test_Orchestrator SHALL deploy and execute validation test suites automatically
4. IF any validation fails, THEN THE Rollback_Handler SHALL immediately redirect 100% traffic to the Blue_Cluster
5. THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL maintain detailed audit logs of all upgrade operations and decisions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an AI/ML engineer, I want the agent to leverage AWS AI services for intelligent decision-making, so that upgrades are based on advanced analysis and reasoning capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Reasoning_Module SHALL integrate with Amazon_Bedrock using Claude 3 Sonnet for complex analysis
2. THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL use Amazon_Comprehend for Named Entity Recognition on release notes
3. WHEN analyzing release notes, THE Amazon_Bedrock SHALL extract breaking changes, deprecations, and required actions
4. THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL use AWS_Step_Functions for orchestrating upgrade workflows and state management
5. WHERE coordination is needed, THE Amazon_EventBridge SHALL provide event-driven notifications and rollback triggers

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and progress tracking for each task and subtask, so that I can verify functionality and monitor upgrade progress in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL maintain a dedicated testing directory structure for validation artifacts
2. WHEN each task executes, THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL generate test results and progress reports
3. THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL store test outputs, logs, and validation results in organized folders
4. THE Progress_Tracker SHALL provide real-time status updates for each upgrade step and subtask
5. WHERE testing fails, THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL preserve failure artifacts for debugging and analysis

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple command-line interface to initiate upgrades, so that I can easily trigger the autonomous upgrade process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CLI SHALL accept cluster name, target version, strategy, and configuration file parameters
2. WHEN executed, THE CLI SHALL initialize and coordinate all agent modules
3. THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL load configuration from YAML files with AWS AI services validation
4. THE CLI SHALL provide real-time progress updates and status information
5. WHERE errors occur, THE CLI SHALL display clear error messages and suggested remediation steps

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a DevOps team lead, I want production-ready deployment capabilities with comprehensive monitoring, so that the agent can be safely deployed in enterprise environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE EKS_Upgrade_Agent SHALL support deployment in multiple environments (local, EKS, AWS Lambda)
